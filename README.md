Rygel Fuentiblanca's Personal Website

This is a personal website built using the Hack4Impact Starter Pack!

Hi!  I am a 2nd year Computer Engineering major, but I am planning to change my major to fully commit to Computer Science!  In my free time, I enjoy playing videogames, watching Anime, and lifting in the gym! I have big hopes of becoming a software engineer in the future, and I hope Hack4Impact can help me with those goals!
