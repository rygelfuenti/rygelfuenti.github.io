        <p>Hi Guys, my name is <strong>Rygel Fuentiblanca</strong> and I am a 2nd year Computer Engineering major, but I am hoping
        to switch to Computer Science this quarter.  I am local as I am from <strong> Santa Maria </strong> which is only about a 30 minute drive
    from Cal Poly.  In my free time, I like to play videogames (Right now I am trying my best to beat the new Wukong game)
    , watch anime(Favorite: <strong>One Piece</strong>), and I like to go to the gym.</p>
        <p>I am hoping to become a full-time software engineer in the future!</p>
